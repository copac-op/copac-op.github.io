            <div class="callout large">
                <p class="h4">Christ Our Peace is fully committed to the biblical truth about Jesus Christ, fully sacramental, and full of the Holy Spirit. We believe in the power of Jesus to transform our lives, relationships, and communities.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Our faith is summarized in the ancient words of the Apostles’ Creed or the contemporary words of the Jerusalem Declaration. (You can read those below.)</p>
            <p>While we ask those being baptized to affirm the Apostles’ Creed and to “live as Christ enjoined,” all are welcome at Christ Our Peace — doubters, skeptics, the curious, and the burned-out-on-church. We invite you to join us as we "cultivate and embody God’s peace through sacramental worship and faithful action."</p>

            <p>As Anglican Christians, we are happy to be part of a large, culturally diverse, global family:</p>

            <h2>Doctrinal Statements</h2>

            <h3>Apostles' Creed</h3>
            <p>
                I believe in God, the Father almighty,<br />
                creator of heaven and earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,<br />
                He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit <br />
                and born of the Virgin Mary.<br />
                He suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br />
                was crucified, died, and was buried.<br />
                He descended to the dead.<br />
                On the third day he rose again.<br />
                He ascended into heaven,<br />
                and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br />
                He will come again to judge the living and the dead.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br />
                the holy catholic Church,<br />
                the communion of saints,<br />
                the forgiveness of sins,<br />
                the resurrection of the body,<br />
                and the life everlasting.
            </p>

            <h3>Jerusalem Declaration</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>1. Salvation</dt>
                <dd>We rejoice in the gospel of God through which we have been saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit. Because God first loved us, we love him and as believers bring forth fruits of love, ongoing repentance, lively hope and thanksgiving to God in all things.</dd>

                <dt>2. The Bible</dt>
                <dd>We believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be the Word of God written and to contain all things necessary for salvation. The Bible is to be translated, read, preached, taught and obeyed in its plain and canonical sense, respectful of the church’s historic and consensual reading.</dd>

                <dt>3. The Creeds</dt>
                <dd>We uphold the four Ecumenical Councils and the three historic Creeds (Apostles' Creed, Nicene Creed, Athanasian Creed) as expressing the rule of faith of the one holy catholic and apostolic Church.</dd>

                <dt>4. Anglican History</dt>
                <dd>We uphold the Thirty-nine Articles as containing the true doctrine of the Church agreeing with God’s Word and as authoritative for Anglicans today.</dd>

                <dt>5. Jesus</dt>
                <dd>We gladly proclaim and submit to the unique and universal Lordship of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, humanity’s only Saviour from sin, judgement and hell, who lived the life we could not live and died the death that we deserve. By his atoning death and glorious resurrection, he secured the redemption of all who come to him in repentance and faith.</dd>

                <dt>6. Worship</dt>
                <dd>We rejoice in our Anglican sacramental and liturgical heritage as an expression of the gospel, and we uphold the 1662 Book of Common Prayer as a true and authoritative standard of worship and prayer, to be translated and locally adapted for each culture.</dd>

                <dt>7. Church Leaders</dt>
                <dd>We recognise that God has called and gifted bishops, priests and deacons in historic succession to equip all the people of God for their ministry in the world. We uphold the classic Anglican Ordinal as an authoritative standard of clerical orders.</dd>

                <dt>8. Marriage &amp; Sexuality</dt>
                <dd>We acknowledge God’s creation of humankind as male and female and the unchangeable standard of Christian marriage between one man and one woman as the proper place for sexual intimacy and the basis of the family. We repent of our failures to maintain this standard and call for a renewed commitment to lifelong fidelity in marriage and abstinence for those who are not married.</dd>

                <dt>9. Sharing Faith</dt>
                <dd>We gladly accept the Great Commission of the risen Lord to make disciples of all nations, to seek those who do not know Christ and to baptize, teach and bring new believers to maturity.</dd>

                <dt>10. Environmental Care &amp; Social Justice</dt>
                <dd>We are mindful of our responsibility to be good stewards of God’s creation, to uphold and advocate justice in society, and to seek relief and empowerment of the poor and needy.</dd>

                <dt>11. Christian Unity</dt>
                <dd>We are committed to the unity of all those who know and love Christ and to building authentic ecumenical relationships. We recognise the orders and jurisdiction of those Anglicans who uphold orthodox faith and practice, and we encourage them to join us in this declaration.</dd>

                <dt>12. Christian Charity</dt>
                <dd>We celebrate the God-given diversity among us which enriches our global fellowship, and we acknowledge freedom in secondary matters. We pledge to work together to seek the mind of Christ on issues that divide us.</dd>

                <dt>13. Theological Clarity</dt>
                <dd>We reject the authority of those churches and leaders who have denied the orthodox faith in word or deed. We pray for them and call on them to repent and return to the Lord.</dd>

                <dt>14. The Goal of History</dt>
                <dd>We rejoice at the prospect of Jesus’ coming again in glory, and while we await this final event of history, we praise him for the way he builds up his church through his Spirit by miraculously changing lives.</dd>
